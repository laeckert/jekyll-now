## Who is Lucy?  
<br>
Hello, everyone! My name is Lucy Eckert. I really like to sit quietly and read. A year ago, I decided to take advantage of my company's really **excellent** tuition reimbursement program and go back to school. I graduated in 2005 with a Geology degree, became a mom a year later, and have worked in the legal field since realizing that was the best way to make enough money to own a house, eat healthy, and be able to sit quietly and read. Now that I'm a graduate student, I have less time to sit quietly and read.

## Why Data Science?  
<br>
Well, I really love collecting and analyzing data. Plus, I started working at a [Tech Company](https://www.redhat.com/en) and wanted to be able to communicate with the engineers. I started the program with **ZERO** programming experience, but now that I'm learning it, I want to know more and more.

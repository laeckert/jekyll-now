title: Being a Data Scientist
---

As a graduate student in the field of applied statistics and data management, I have been thinking about what it means to be a data scientist and what it means to be a statistician. 

Several years ago, while working in civil litigation and managing large-scale (1,000,000+ pages) document review projects, I had my first peek into data science - though I didnt realize it at the time. I was using an exciting new feature that my software representative insisted would change my life - predictive analytics. Indeed this tool saved a lot of time and turned up some helpful results for our court cases. Then, I wasnt thinking about what was “under the hood”. If you’d asked me how the software was returning results, I would have mumbled something about an engineer writing some magic code. 

Fast forward a few years, to my exciting foray into NCSU’s graduate certificate program in applied statistics and data management. After spending time learning about both statistics and programming, I would be much better equipped to answer that question, and my answer would be that a data scientist used statistics and programming to create the code that would ingest metadata and return analytics. To me, a data scientist is someone who is fluent in both programming and statistics, and has the subject matter knowledge to identify and solve problems. As Justin Megahan mentions in his post on MixPanel entitled, “This is the difference between statistics and data science”, data science is statistics plus coding. 

In a way, I think of data scientists as really technical project managers. They see the big picture and use their knowledge of statistics and modeling, as well as their understanding of what is possible with programming, to create a project plan and implement it. The way I see myself relating to this is through my day job. I work in legal compliance at a technology company, and am tasked with identifying big picture goals, and then creating and managing project plans to achieve them. Though I am a relative novice in the field of statistics, I understand that the more I introduce analytics to my processes, the more robust my initiatives can become.

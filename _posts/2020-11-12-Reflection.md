### We've Come so Far!
<br>

I look back at my first blog post, from August of this year, and nod my head in agreement - for the most part I agree with what I said about the field of data science. 
Though I did have some awkward mis-statements, I did have my head wrapped around the concept. As I put it, data scientists could be described as "project managers. 
They see the big picture and use their knowledge of statistics and modeling, as well as their understanding of what is possible with programming, to create a project 
plan and implement it."
<br>

I do think I was a little naive about some things in August. I seemed to think that, after two semesters of statistics and some basic regression, that I had an 
understanding of modeling. In August, I didnt know the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, or even that that thesetwo concepts existed. 
I can discuss unsupervised learning, but am humbled about how far I have to mastery. 
<br>

In addition to my progress to 'knowing that I know nothing', I don't think I had fully appreciated the patience and precision needed to be a sucessful data scientist. 
Picture a ball of yarn, neatly wrapped and pleasing to the eye. This simplicity is how I want my code to look. What my code actually looks like is if you had 
thrown the yarn off a cliff and wadded it up. Ok, so this is an exaggeration - but I really have an appreciation for the concept of elegant simplicity. A master can take
some really complicated data and make it feel simple and understandable, and have a "neat ball of yarn" on the back end. I am not there yet but recognize this as an area
of improvement.

As far as using R going forward, I am already doing this! I have a quarterly report that I usually build in Excel with Pivot tables, but built as an R Markdown document 
for Q3. Though I think Shiny apps are really cool, I dont think I will use them at my job as I am the only one in my department who uses R. I love that I can download R to 
any computer, at any time, and start working - open source is really awesome. I plan to integrate using R into my job for two reasons - 1). So I dont lose my knowledge and 
skills, and 2) Because I can do some really useful things in it that will benefit my team. I'll be using less Excel, and am OK with that! Open source is the future! 
<br>

One final note - I am most excited about the confidence and curiousity that I have gained this semester, both about programming and about statistics. It really is a gift 
to have enough understanding of both of these areas to delve deeper and follow rabbit holes.

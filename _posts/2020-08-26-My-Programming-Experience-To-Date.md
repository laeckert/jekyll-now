### An Ode to R
<br>
Prior to taking ST555 in the summer of 2020, I had near zero programming experience - in the early 1990s I played around on an Apple IIe. In May 2020, when the world was bearing the weight of a global pandemic, I was trying to focus on lectures and navidate my way around SAS. It was not the best experience - if I could do it again I'd take some sort of introductory programming course orient myself and not start out with so many nerves. 
<br>
Perhaps thanks to my hereditary stubbornness, I made it through ST555 with a B+, and more importantly, with quite a bit more confidence than when I started. 
<br>
I would pick R over SAS any day of the week. To me, R is much more logical and digestible and I feel it is set up for the user to succeed, where SAS is quite fussy. Furthermore, the fact that R will allow for packages to be installed shows its flexibility. I appreciate that R can be installed on any computer, making me more likely to try to use it at work - I wont have to get budgetary approval for new software. Finally, I find the documentation for R to be more helpful than that available for SAS.

It's possible that my experience of learning SAS v learning R was so different due to confidence and experience levels, but the takeaway is that the accessibility of R would likely make it my choice between the two. I am looking forward to learning additional languages - perhaps Python next.

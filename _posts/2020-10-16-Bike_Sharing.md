### Building Models to Predict Use of Bike Sharing  

#### I have use different techniques to create predictive models for estimating bike sharing numbers using certain publically available data. 

You can see my Githib Pages Repo [here](https://laeckert.github.io/Project_2/).

**Some reflections on this project.**

Now that I am beginning to have some confidence as a programmer (not a ton, but improving), 
I find I am having more and more fun with data exploration and feeling some freedom to try 
different techniques in modeling. That sentiment put me on a good footing for getting started on this project. 
To make it even better, I am an environmentalist and love the concept of bike sharing. So, when I learned of the
subject of this project, I was pretty excited to dive right in! 

**What would I do differently?**
Well, I spent a lot of time playing around with the data to understand which variables would effect bike sharing 
numbers. That wasnt entirely the point of the project, but it was fun to explore. I also found out about the concept
of using dummy variables, so I explored that for a while too. I put some good time into creating the models, but what I
failed to save a lot of time for was the automation. I figured it out eventually, but it was several hours of panicking. 
As noted in my blog post for ST558 Project 1, my greatest problem was time management. Unfortunately, I havent totally
solved that issue yet! But I am getting better...submitting this homework before dinner time on the due date is certainly an
improvement!

**The most difficult part?**
The automation was a little difficult as my original concept was not at all the correct concept. I had to go back to the 
drawing board a few times to achieve success with automation. Though I understood how we automated the NFL data during 
the lecture, I need to practice automation in real life more to gain confidence. 

**Takeaways?**
Watching my work computer spin and spin trying to run models is kind of terrifying. I have had this ridiculous debate 
with myself since August about whether it is irresponsible to be using my work computer for school stuff. Here we are, 2/3
of the way through the semester and I am still using my work computer. But I digress... Thankfully all of my models ran
and I learned a lot about models and factors that effect bike sharing numbers in the DC Metro Area. I had a lot of fun,
with just a sprinkle of frustration, with this project. I hope you enjoy reviewing it!

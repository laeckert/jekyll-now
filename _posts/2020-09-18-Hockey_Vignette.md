I have created a Vignette that uses NHL data to explore how a data scientist can leverage APIs to create dataframes, and perform queries of thos data.

You can see my repository [here](https://github.com/laeckert/Project_1).

**Some reflections on this project.**

I learned a lot in this project. To start, there is a massive amount of data available to us, and I am just not that comfortable with the quantity of it yet. I think this will come in practice. For this project, although I accessed the full data as required by the assignment, I primarily stuck to Bruins data for my queries. There are currently 31 active franchises in the NHL, and I selected the Bruins to explore because I am from Massachusettes. 

I was surprised to learn how organized this league is. The teams are spread pretty much evenly across leagues, and spending some time reviewing the location data showed me that the arenas are spread pretty evenly across the United States. 

As a budding data scientist, I have a lot to learn about how to put a project together. For this one, I spent a lot of time making my functions rock-solid, but what I should have been spending my time doing was asking legit hockey fans some questions about what they'd be curious to learn from this data. When it came to the queries, I really had to brainstorm on what to explore. To be sure, a real data scientist would have their eye on the findings and not worry so much about cobbling together the functions. That is a level of confidence that I am still building. 

I did have a hard time putting the endpoint functions together, and spent a lot of time with trial and error before finally pasting my data from all of my little R files into the main project file. I hope to improve with function writing with time. I also have some embarassing weird files and comments in my repo that I cannot seem to remove. I know for next time that I will be more careful about what I commit!

I had a number of challenges toward the end of the project, and I suspect most of these could have been abated with improved time management. I bet everyone says this, but my day job is *really* challenging right now. I have so little time for school during the day, and am exhausted by 7 pm when I dig into school work. Some of my challenges: kables that looked beautiful all week suddenly rendered as a series of 0s and 1s. What the heck? Also, my TOC started failing (luckily I fixed this), and my histogram code seems to crash the file and has been removed. 

A final and **IMPORTANT NOTE** - as of 10:21 p.m. on 09/18/2020 my github pages is under maintenance, so the link above is to my repository. My Vignette is visible from there. 

All in all, this has been mostly fun and very eye opening. I hope you enjoy my exploration!
